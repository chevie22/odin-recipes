    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara (Italian: [karboˈnaːra]) is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper. It is typical of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.</p>

    <p>The cheese is usually pecorino romano. Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of cheeses. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but rigatoni or bucatini are also used. While guanciale, a cured pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta, and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g spaghetti</li>
        <li>12 strips bacon, cut into 1/2 cm slices</li>
